This is a personal project I use for helping me with my astrophotography projects.
I built it so that I can more easily identify project attributes when adding new photos of 
galaxies and nebula (captured by me) to my [AstroBin](https://app.astrobin.com/u/nickkohrn#gallery) gallery.

If you're interested in trying it out, pull down the [`main-ui`](https://github.com/nickkohrn/AstroSummary/tree/main-ui) branch.
